# git-stats-exporter
Fetch and emit github stats as prometheus metrics.


## Description
The Git stats exporter is a Kubernetes controller that fetches Github statistics like open pull requests, issues, stars, etc. and emits them as prometheus metrics to build nice dashboards.

## Getting Started
Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

## Example:


```
$ kubectl get repo aws-ec2-instance-selector -o yaml
apiVersion: src.bwag.me/v1
kind: Repo
metadata:
  name: aws-ec2-instance-selector
spec:
  owner: aws
  name: amazon-ec2-instance-selector
  ghTokenSecretRef: gh-token
status:
  lastQuery: "2022-08-07T17:34:45Z"
  state: Synchronized
```

```
$ curl git-stats-exporter:8080/metrics
...
# HELP gh_repo_forks Number of forks
# TYPE gh_repo_forks gauge
gh_repo_forks{owner="aws",repo="amazon-ec2-instance-selector"} 67
# HELP gh_repo_open_issues Number of open issues
# TYPE gh_repo_open_issues gauge
gh_repo_open_issues{owner="aws",repo="amazon-ec2-instance-selector"} 11
# HELP gh_repo_open_pull_requests Number of open pull requests
# TYPE gh_repo_open_pull_requests gauge
gh_repo_open_pull_requests{owner="aws",repo="amazon-ec2-instance-selector"} 1
# HELP gh_repo_stars Number of stars
# TYPE gh_repo_stars gauge
gh_repo_stars{owner="aws",repo="amazon-ec2-instance-selector"} 406
# HELP gh_repo_subscribers Number of subscribers
# TYPE gh_repo_subscribers gauge
gh_repo_subscribers{owner="aws",repo="amazon-ec2-instance-selector"} 11
...
```

### Running on the cluster
1. Setup a Github Token as a K8s Secret (optional)

The github API has a fairly low API request limit, so setting up a github token can be useful if you are monitoring more than on repository.
https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token

```sh
echo -n "<gh-token>" > /tmp/gh-token
kubectl create secret generic gh-token --from-file /tmp/gh-token
```

2. Install Sample Repos (or create your own):

```sh
kubectl apply -f config/samples/
```

3. Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:
	
```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/git-stats-exporter:tag
```
	
4. Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/git-stats-exporter:tag
```

### Uninstall CRDs
To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### Undeploy controller
UnDeploy the controller to the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```


### How it works
Create `Repo` resources that point to your Github repositories and collect the metrics with prometheus.


### Test It Out
1. Install the CRDs into the cluster:

```sh
make install
```

2. Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):

```sh
make run
```

**NOTE:** You can also run this in one step by running: `make install run`

### Modifying the API definitions
If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
